1-I preferred to write the API tasks given to me in the cucumber framework because it is more descriptive and understandable

2- I aimed to write cleaner code by placing the data in a MAP container

3-I used the OOP concept and created Pojo classes to use the desired data and although I did not actively use it in these tasks, I included some classes for you to see because it is in my normal framework.

4- The most difficult thing for me during the tasks was the URL, as a result of my research, I saw that such problems can be encountered in this URL and therefore I could not pull the urls from the Base class and defined them in the same class.

5- I encountered a problem that I thought was caused by the URL while doing De Serialization.

6- Despite everything, I was happy that these tasks challenged and improved me.

7- In my get test, I called the user list and printed it on the screen and tested the ststus code

8- In the GetId test, I called a specific user and compared and verified all their information, while doing this I used De Serialization and compared them in this way

9-When I sent the information requested from me in my Post Test, it returned me userId and I compared and tested this id

10-Delete I deleted the data in the url sent in my test and checked that the body of the response is empty

11- In the patch test, I showed the isActive data as a boolean value and assigned it

12- I compared the userId returned to me when I changed the data requested in the put test.
